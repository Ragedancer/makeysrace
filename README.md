# Using Visual, Block-Based, Event-Driven Language to Teach Coding Skills

## Project Description

MaKey MaKey Pool is a fun pool game that teaches students coding skills using “if-statements”, “while loops” and building blocks with the Scratch programming language. The MaKey MaKey circuit board will be used in place of the computer mouse/keyboard mousepad. The project was created by Makey Your Shot, a group of students a part of the Technology Ambassadors Program at Georgia Gwinnett College. The [Technology Ambassadors Program](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/schools/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program/) is a program that offers students opportunities to learn more about technology, and helps them develop creativity, leadership, communication, and teamwork skills, while also giving them the oppurtunity to do community outreach. The target for this project were people of all ages that were unfamiliar with technology. Here are the results that were gathered from the 72 participants during the class workshops that were held:

## Outreach Activities

1. **TAP Expo, Apr 28, GGC** – To promote IT field and the TAP program to college students
2. **Class Workshops** – on Apr 9 and Apr 13 (2 occasions), to promote IT field to non-IT college students

## Technologies

1. **Scratch Programming Language**: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It was created in 2002, and is an interactive programming language that allows users to create interactive stories, games, and animations.

2. **MaKey MaKey**: The [MaKey MaKey](https://makeymakey.com/) is an electronic invention kit for all ages! The Makey Makey allows you to take everyday objects and combine them with the internet. Using the alligator clips attached to any conductive material you can control the keyboard of your computer, such as the space bar, arrow keys and left click of the mouse.

## Project Goals

**Goals**

- Teach 'if-statements' and 'while loops'

**Results**

- We presented to 72 students during the online workshop.
- 90% of our participant were not IT majors.
- Only 10% of Our participant were IT Majors.
- Our participants ages ranged from 18 years to 58 years old
- 8 students submitted their new game to us
- We were able to verify their understanding of if-else and while loops as shown by their game
